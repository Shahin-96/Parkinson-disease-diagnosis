**Description:**

This project focused on leveraging machine learning techniques to diagnose Parkinson's disease based on speech signals dataset. The multi-step process, from data **preprocessing** and **dimensionality reduction** to **model evaluation**, contributes to the development of accurate and robust diagnostic tools in healthcare.

**Procedure:**

Utilized a Parkinson's disease dataset from Kaggle, balancing it via **oversampling** to mitigate biases and improve model performance. Standardized features using **MinMax Scaler**. Applied **dimensionality reduction** techniques _e.g.,_ LDA, ICA, and PCA to transform the data into fewer dimensions and enhance model efficiency.Trained using **k-Nearest Neighbors** and **Support Vector Machine** for classification and regression in Parkinson's diagnosis. Assessed model effectiveness through **evaluation metrics** _e.g.,_ confusion matrix and ROC curve.
